# Introduction

## Codelabs vs the Guide

How is the codelabs section different from the guide? Why is this necessary?

- **Greater Focus**: In the guide, we're essentially telling a story. Each section builds on and assumes knowledge from each previous section. In the codelabs section, each experiment can and should stand on its own. This means experiments can focus on one specific aspect of Leaf, rather than having to give a general overview.

- **Greater Depth**: To avoid making the guide too long, we try to include only the simplest possible examples to help you understand each feature. Then we move on. In the codelabs section, we can include more complex examples, combining features in interesting ways. Each experiment can also be as long and detailed as it needs to be, in order to fully explore its niche.

- **Teaching PHP**: In the guide, we assume at least intermediate familiarity with PHP and some concepts as well. For example, we won't explain how forms and network requests work and how data is read. In the codelabs however, essential PHP features and concepts can be explored and explained in the context of how they help us build better Leaf apps.
